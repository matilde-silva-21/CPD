To run this project, open on IntelliJ, or your prefered Java IDE, the directory containing both `assign1` and `assign2` folders. We will assume this folder is called `g10`. 

Then in your running configurations, for both the `Client` and `Server` classes, please insert the working directory as `g10`.

After that, you can run the `Server` class first and as many instances of the `Client` class as you want. 

Enjoy the game!
